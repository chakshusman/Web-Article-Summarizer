      "Summary:\n",
      "United Nations — Israel has accused the Palestinian militant group Hamas of committing \"double war crimes\" by not only firing rockets at civilians, but firing them from and near United Nations-run facilities in the Gaza Strip that should be \"out of bounds\" — and at least one senior U.N. official who spoke with CBS News agrees.\n",
      "Hamas' use of civilians as human shields in Gaza was confirmed during the last major conflict in 2014, but its use of U.N. facilities to house and launch weapons has increased over the last eight years, putting U.N. staff and other civilians at greater risk, Israeli officials say.\n",
      "Jonathan Conricus told CBS News that Israel's forces have seen \"a systemic abuse by Hamas of sites and locations that are supposed to enjoy special protection under the Geneva Convention and humanitarian law,\" including not only U.N. facilities, but other schools, clinics, mosques, churches and hospitals.\n",
      "U.N. facilities are \"supposed to be out of bounds, according to the law of armed conflict, and specially protected,\" Conricus said, calling Hamas' use of U.N. locations \"a double war crime.\"\n",
      "The IDF shared three recent photos with CBS News, including one that it said showed a Hamas rocket launching site positioned in a UNRWA warehouse facility in southern Gaza, and another very close to an UNRWA-run school.\n",
      "Israel Defense Forces officials say this photo shows a Hamas rocket launch site located in a diplomatic building near a U.N. school in Gaza.\n",
      "Israel Defense Forces officials say this photo shows a Hamas rocket launch site located inside a U.N. building in Gaza.\n",
      "During the group's last major war with Israel, between 2012 and 2014, a U.N. inquiry found weapons had been placed inside an UNRWA school in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip and that it was highly likely that an unidentified Palestinian armed group could have used the school premises to launch attacks.\n",
      "\"According to our intelligence, not only is it happening but it has been expanded over the years, tunnels underneath U.N. facilities, rocket launchers next to or very — just within the compounds of U.N. facilities, and the general endangering of U.N. staff and U.N. facilities by Hamas, systematically,\" Conricus told CBS News.\n",
      "\"Hamas and other militants use civilians as human shields and continue to launch rockets indiscriminately towards Israel,\" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said this week.\n",
